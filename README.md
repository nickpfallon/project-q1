This website uses the Edamam API. It accepts a search for a food item and returns
recipe pictures and titles related to that name. There are two buttons at the top
of the search results page. The button with a "cancelation" icon rejects the recipe
that is shown on the page and presents a new recipe. The button with a "checkmark"
icon accepts the shown recipe as one that the user would like to see more information
about; it takes the user to a new page that shows the image of the recipe, the
recipe ingredients, and a link to an external site with the full instructions for
the recipe.
